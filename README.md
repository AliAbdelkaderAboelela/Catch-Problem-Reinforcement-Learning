# Catch Problem Reinforcement Learning

This project explores the application of Q-learning with a neural network (NN) and rendering buffer techniques to solve the Catch Problem. Two variations of Q-learning are implemented:

1. **Q-learning with Neural Network (NN):** Traditional Q-learning with a neural network as the function approximator for Q-values.

2. **Q-learning with NN and Rendering Buffer:** An extension of Q-learning that incorporates a rendering buffer to capture additional context for decision-making.

## Problem Description

The Catch Problem involves catching falling objects in a discrete grid. The goal is to train an agent to catch as many objects as possible.
